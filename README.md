## Creating admin user
- first account on the freshly installed system is admin account
- it can have a generic name like CS-admin and a password we can agree upon
## Creating employee account, a.k.a, standard account
- run script create-user.sh (WIP)
- it will prompt for user name and a password
  - user name is first and last name of the new employee
  - password is generic **combostrike** which will prompt users to change themselves afterwards
- also this script activates FileVault encryption for the created user
## Login inside created user account
